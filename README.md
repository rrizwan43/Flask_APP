In this Project We'll be creating a simple app using Flask framework in python. 
We will create a basic route '/' for home page and so when our app loads the content will be shown here.
In this project we will be using sqllite3 database model, first we'll create a data base in sqllite3 named 'database.db' then we'll connect to it.
After connecting to it we'll create a table name customers columns id, name and photo
And add some dummy data in it.
